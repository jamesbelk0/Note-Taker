## Description
1. Using an express server, create a localhost note taker that can create, save and delete notes. Using the 'Save' class from OOP to keep it more simpified (at least to me). 
2. Api/HTML routes are split for ease of access if needing to change anything. 

## Usage
- Start a server using 'npm start'
- pull up 'localhost:3001'
- Click on 'Get Started' and create/pull up/ or delete a note as needed
- Enjoy your memory support tool! (I need one)
